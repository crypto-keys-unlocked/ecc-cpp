# Contributing to ecc-cpp

First off, thank you for considering contributing to ecc-cpp. It's people like you that make ecc-cpp such a great tool.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the ecc-cpp Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## What we are looking for

ecc-cpp is an open-source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code which can be incorporated into ecc-cpp itself.

## How to contribute

If you don't know where to start, here are some suggestions:

* Review the [issues](https://github.com/crypto-keys-unlocked/ecc-cpp/issues) for open challenges and features being requested by users.
* Engage with other users and developers on the [Discussions](https://github.com/crypto-keys-unlocked/ecc-cpp/discussions) page.
* Submit fixes for any bugs you may find.
* Propose new features or improvements to existing ones.

Please note we have a quick pull request process, but it will be helpful if you could provide a clear explanation of what your PR does and why.

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. The Pull Request will be merged once it is approved by other community members, or by the project maintainer.

## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/your-repo/ecc-cpp/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).

People **love** thorough bug reports.
